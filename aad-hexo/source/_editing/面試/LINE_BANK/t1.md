The size of the moon changes as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 continuously. When the size of the moon is 15, it represents a full moon. When it's 0, it represents a dark moon or a crescent moon.
The characteristic of the moon is that it gets bigger again when its size is 0 (dark moon or crescent moon) and gets smaller again when its size is 15 (full moon). Based on this rule, you can predict whether the moon will get bigger or smaller the next day by observing the history of the past several days. If the data is [3,4,5], the moon will get bigger the next day and its size will be 6. When the data is [14,13], the moon will get smaller the next day and its size will be 12. However, if the data is [6], you cannot know if the moon will get bigger or smaller the next day.
Given the history P as the parameter, write a function solution to determine whether the size of the moon will get bigger, smaller, or unknown. Return 1, 0, and -1 when the size of the moon will get bigger, smaller, or unknown, respectively.

Constraints
Length of history P : natural number less than or equal to 50.
Size of the moon : a number between 0 and 15.
The size of the moon always changes following the rule. That is, there is no data such as "P" = [2,4,7].
Examples
P	result
[3,4,5]	1
[14,13]	0
[6]	-1
Example #1, 2, 3
It is the same as the example in the problem statement.
