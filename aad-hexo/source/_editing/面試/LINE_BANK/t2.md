Suppose that there is a farm with size of n x n. In this farm, radish, sweet potato, and potato are grown up together. In each 1 x 1 space, one of these crops is grown. You want to know the number of areas when a map i given which represents radish, sweet potato, and potato as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. When the same crop is adjacent in direction of up, down, left, and right, they are regarded as the same area.

Following shows an example:

구역나누기그림_f_dgey0r.png

When the above map representing crops is given, there are 2 radish areas, 1 sweet potato area, and 2 potato areas.

Given a map representing each crop as number v as parameter, write a function solution to return the number of areas for each crop. In the above example, return [2,1,2]. The returned value should be in order of radish, sweet potato, and potato.

Constraints
The map representing crops v is given as a 2-dimensional array, and there is no other number than 0, 1, and 2.
n : natural number less than or equal to 100.
Examples
v	answer
[[0,0,1,1],[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,1],[0,0,0,2]]	[2,1,2]
[[0,0,1],[2,2,1],[0,0,0]]	[2,1,1]
Example #1
This is the same with an example in problem statement.

Example #2
001
221
000
In the above case, return [2,2,1] because there are 2 radish areas, 1 sweet potato area, and 1 potato area.
