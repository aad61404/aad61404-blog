The rules of the worm game is as follows:

The initial length of the worm is 1, and it is placed at any position in the W x H matrix. The player can choose the position, and the worm eats the number on the selected space.
There is a number on each position. The worm moves in one direction among East, West, South, and North and eats the number. Its length increases by 1 after eating the number. Note that the worm should eat a number larger than the last number.
If there is no more space for the worm to eat to increase the length of worm, the game ends and the length of worm L is shown as the result.
When a W x H matrix R is given, L changes based on the initial position. Write a function to return the maximum length of worm max(L).

Constraints
W, H : natural number less than or equal to 500, and they may be the same or different each other.
A number on space : natural number less than or equal to 300,000.
Examples
R	max(L)
[ [3,9,2,7],[10,6,8,4],[1,4,9,10],[5,7,8,4] ]	6
Example #1
When placing the worm at the third row and the first column, its length increases up to 6 by eating 1,4,7,8,9, and 10. Hence, the maximum length of worm is 6.
