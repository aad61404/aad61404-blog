Days of the week are represented as three-letter strings("Mon""Tue""Wed""Thu""Fri""Sat""Sun").
Write a function solution that, given a string S representing the day of the week and an integer K (between 0 and 500, inclusive), returns the day of the week that is K days later.
For example, given S = "Wed" and K = 2, the function should return "Fri".
Given S = "Sat" and K = 23, the function should return "Mon".


// you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
// console.log('this is a debug message');

function solution(S, K) {
    // write your code in JavaScript (Node.js 8.9.4)
    var arr = ["Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"];
    var sIndex = arr.indexOf(S);
    var calK = K % 7;
    var resultIndex = sIndex + calK;
    if(resultIndex > 6) {
        resultIndex = resultIndex - 7;
        return arr[resultIndex];
    } else {
         return arr[resultIndex];
    }
}
